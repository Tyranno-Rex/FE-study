# Frontend Study Repository

This repository is dedicated to studying and organizing various frontend technologies. I will be documenting my learning journey on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Flutter. As of now, the repository contains materials for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only. More content will be added in the future as I continue my studies.
